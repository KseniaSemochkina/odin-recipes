        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If you want to serve something both easy and hearty, make spaghetti alla carbonara. Think of it as a pasta coated in a dressing made of eggs and cheese, with delectable bits of pork throughout. It’s a classic Italian meal that relies on pastas with a high surface-to-volume ratio so the eggs cook well on the noodles. This creamy carbonara recipe is ideal with spaghetti, fettuccine or linguine as a base—you can't go wrong.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons parsley</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>2 cups half and half</li>
            <li>4 ounces pancetta</li>
            <li>2 cups parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare spaghetti or similar noodles al dente.</b> While the pasta cooks, add the pancetta to a large skillet over medium-low heat and sauté until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
            <li><b>Add the garlic</b> to the pancetta drippings in the pan and sauté over medium heat for 1 minute.</li>
            <li><b>Add half and half</b> to the skillet and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li><b>Ladle about 2 tablespoons of the warm sauce into the egg yolks</b> and stir briskly to temper them, then whisk the egg yolks into the sauce. Whisk in 1 1/2 cups of the Parmesan cheese. Stir in the black pepper and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li><b>Add the cooked spaghetti, pancetta and parsley</b> to the skillet and toss well to combine.</li>
            <li><b>Garnish with remaining Parmesan cheese</b> and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
