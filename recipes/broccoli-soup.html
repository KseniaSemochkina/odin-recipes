        <div class="description">
            <p>This Broccoli Cheddar Soup is creamy, it is full of flavor, and you are eating your vegetables so GO YOU! You should pat yourself on the back. Forget that it is swimming in butter, cream, and cheese. Let's just focus on the veggies part.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <ul class="myUL">
                <li>8 Tablespoons Butter (divided)</li>
                <li>1 large Onion</li>
                <li>1 large Carrot (shredded or finely diced)</li>
                <li>3 Garlic Cloves</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Flour</li>
                <li>3 cups Chicken Broth</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Dried Mustard Powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Pepper</li>
                <li>3 cups Broccoli (chopped)</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups Half-n-Half</li>
                <li>3 cups Sharp Cheddar Cheese (grated)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Start by sauteing butter and onions until they begin to soften.</b> Add in garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. You never want to saute garlic for too long or it can become brown and bitter. No one likes brown and bitter garlic.</li>
                <li><b>Make a roux by adding more butter, flour, and chicken broth.</b> This is the base of the soup and helps to thicken it. You may substitute cornstarch for flour if you are looking to make this gluten-free.</li>
                <li><b>Add in seasonings, fresh broccoli, carrots, and half-n-half.</b> A quick and easy tip is to use a food processor to cut up your onions, garlic, carrots, and broccoli. It is a huge time saver! You just need to pulse it once or twice. After the liquid is added, let the soup simmer and thicken.</li>
                <li><b>The key to making this extra creamy and not ending up with a grainy texture, is to add your cheese in small amounts.</b> You want to add the cheese in 1/2 cup increments and stir well in between each addition. </li>
            </ol>
